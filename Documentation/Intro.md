# How to get familiar with project documentation?

Hello, you probably didn't notice me before, ~~saint senpai~~, but I'm glad you glanced at me. Let's begin crusader. 

In this project documentation, we really like to use hashtags, for example, the #concept hashtag describes all pages that has a little bit of information about more glorious things in the future.

Also, don't overuse *additional* **signs** of exclamation, *please*. Better connect your game ideas with link flow, for example, you can read [[Base concept of the game]].

And one more thing you should know before diving into the hell of our documents - is â€¦
# headers. 
## Use
